This gem encapsulates linter rules for https://docs.rubocop.org/en/stable/[rubocop] that can be applied to any Ruby application or service within AngelList stack. It comes with a multiple config files which deactivate some of RuboCop's features. It is meant as a less restrictive foundation that you can use directly or base your style discussions on.

IMPORTANT: The gems' ruleset also loads the https://relaxed.ruby.style/[relaxed ruby style] guide version 2.5, saved into a local file `.rubocop_relaxed.yml`.

== Public Service Announcement

=== The Merits of Linting

The debate is over: automatic formatters and linters have won, period. You can argue with a bus or a mountain, but you won't win that argument. Same here.

Please use rubocop to auto-correct your PRs.

 * It's good for you,
 * It's good for other developers who will be reading your code,
 * It's good for the business, and
 * It's good for the tests.

=== Challenging the Status Quo

There are many scenarios where you may disagree with a given rule, either in general, or in a specific context.

Here are your choices:

. For in-place overrides that only happen once or twice, use in-line comments to disable and immediately re-enable the rule:
+
[source,ruby]
----
# lib/path/to-my-file.rb
# rubocop: disable Metrics/MethodLength
def very_long_method
  # very long body [snip]
end
# rubocop: enable Metrics/MethodLength
----
+
. For per-file or folder rule overrides, add them to your local `.rubocop.yml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# .rubocop.yml
Metrics/MethodLength:
  Exclude:
    - lib/path/to-my-file.rb
----
+
. Add an entire rule overide into your local `.rubocop.yml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# .rubocop.yml
Metrics/MethodLength:
  Exclude:
    - lib/path/to-my-file.rb
----
+
. Finally, if you want to propose a global change with one or more rules, dependencies, or exclusions, add your change to the appropriate file under `config/`, submit a pull request, and then announce your proposal and the PR in the appropriate Slack channel (you might want to create a poll). Once you are done receiving the feedback — move forward appropriately.

== Scope

This gem is released as a public ruby gem (available at https://rubygems.org/gems/angellist-style[rubygems]) for ease of deployment.

== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'angellist-style'
----

And then execute:

 $ bundle install

Alternatively, run:

 $ gem install angellist-style -N

== Usage

To use the styles contained in this gem, add this to your `.rubocop.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
  angellist-style:
    - .rubocop.yml

# Local overrides.
Namespace/Rule1:
  Enabled: false

Namespace/Rule2:
  Enabled: false

# ... etc ....
----

=== Applying Partial Rulesets

While not recommended, you can load the rule overrides only for certain Rubocop top-level categories, which are all grouped in YAML files under the `config/` folder.

If you inspect the file `.rubocop_angellist.yml`, you'll see the full list of rule files that is being included.

Here we show a version you'd specify in your project's `.rubocop.yml`.  If you prefer not to apply some of the categories, just delete the corresponding line that you do not want to include:

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
angellist-style:
- .rubocop_relaxed.yml
- config/require.yml
- config/all_cops.yml
- config/layout.yml
- config/lint.yml
- config/metrics.yml
- config/naming.yml
- config/rails.yml
- config/rspec.yml
- config/security.yml
- config/style.yml
----

=== Generating a TODO File

Rubocop can generate a local "TODO" file, which you can check-in — *this alllows you to run rubocop on CI and have it pass all the legacy code, but fail any new code that does not satisfy the linter.*

[source, bash]
$ bundle exec rubocop --auto-gen-config

=== Building the Gem

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

Gem management is provided by Rake tasks:

* To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

* If you have not yet authenticated with rubygems.org, make sure to create an account, and protect it with the MFA. Then

* To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to https://rubygems.org[rubygems.org].
